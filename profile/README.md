# 👋 Hi, We are JUJY
We are developing **Etcd-AutoBackup** service that backup k8s cluster's etcd snpshot data automatically. ETCD plays an important role in maintaining the stability and reliability of the cluster. If ETCD data is stored in a cloud environment to prevent accidents, the risk of data loss can be reduced. So we set our sights on creating etcd autobackup service which is **🕹️automatic** & **🌼user-friendly** using **Helm** and **Cloud**.
## 🧸 Our team values

## 🐻‍❄️ OIDC
We started this project as part of [OIDC](https://www.oidc.co.kr/) (Open Infrastructure Development Competition). It's an infrastructure development competition in Korea, and we got to participate as a good opportunity. For reference, this is how it started, but we plan to continue developing even after the competition is over😁.
